        <p>Wizards are renegade spellcasters who use their bodies as vessels for arcane energy, forsaking the more careful path favored by other magic users. They manipulate all manner of forces to disintegrate, burn, and freeze their foes, and they can control time and light to teleport, create powerful illusions, and deflect oncoming attacks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Wizards grip wands and staves to focus their less potent magics, blasting at their enemies while gathering the energy or time necessary to destroy them in a dazzling hail of arcane might.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With few exceptions, wizard attacks are conducted at a distance, away from danger. As living artillery, wizards are well suited to relying on long-range destructive power.

    <section> 
        <p>Witch doctors’ inborn connection to the Unformed Land allows them to tap into a deep well of spiritual energy, called Mana.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Mana is a vast but slowly-regenerating resource; witch doctors must be choosy with their attack spells and hexes to ensure that they don’t leave themselves depleted of power and exposed to enemy attacks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since Mana returns ponderously, witch doctors conserve it by relying on semi-permanent additions to their arsenal, such as their summoned mongrels and the horrific gargantuan, which can offer protection and chew through enemies without any further mana cost.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Witch doctors have a sizeable reservoir of energy to call upon at once, and, when they need to, they can deploy immense blasts of destructive force and cut a swath across nearly any battleground in a short period of time.</p>

    <section>
        <h1 class="firstHeading">Unique Equipment</h1>
        
        <p>Though witch doctors make use of a variety of weaponry, they boast several one-of-a-kind pieces of equipment. Mojos are fragile talismans held in the off-hand; instead of being used directly as weapons, they aid witch doctors in warding off the wrong dark forces…and calling out to the right ones. Witch doctors have also been known to carry enchanted ceremonial daggers. Unlike common knives, these blades are honed towards one purpose – human sacrifice – and so they are well-suited to ending lives.
