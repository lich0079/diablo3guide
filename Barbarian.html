        <h1 class="firstHeading">Class Design</h1>
        <p>The Diablo III Barbarian is an evolutionary improvement on the Diablo II Barbarian. He (or she) retains some of the same skills, such as Whirlwind and Leap Attack, but has a variety of new skills to unleash on her enemies. One of the features of the class is also Fury, which is an alternative resource to mana for Barbarians. Instead of a globe of energy that needs refilling, it's a meter of the pure anger the Barbarian feels in combat, slowly building up as she deals or receives damage. Fury allows her to pull off extraordinary feats with skills that require Fury.

        <h1 class="firstHeading">Fury</h1>
        <p>Fury is the Barbarian's resource pool in Diablo III. Fury is generated by dealing and taking damage, and spent when skills are used. Barbarians expend Fury when using skills, but may regain as much or more than the skill cost, if it deals a lot of damage.
