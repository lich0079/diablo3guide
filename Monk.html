        <h1 class="firstHeading">Monk</h1>
        <p>The Monk is a <b>melee</b> fighter, with an emphasis on speed, combos, aura bonuses, and tactics, rather than the brute force of the Barbarian. Many of the Monk's skills have an Eastern martial arts influence, while his appearance is a mixture of European medieval monks with saffron robes and fashions drawing from the Eastern, Shao Lin style influence. The Monk uses <a>Spirit</a> as a resource pool. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="firstHeading">Class Design</h1>
        <p>The monk was partly made as an opposite to the Barbarian, with more focused gameplay. He is also relatively weak, so a lot of the class design is built upon the monk debuffing his foes, to receive less damage himself.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h1 class="firstHeading">Spirit</h1>
        <p>Spirit is the Monk's resource in Diablo III. It is generated by using Normal attacks and combo skills, and spent by using other skills.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Monk skills can be divided into three categories: <a>Combos</a>, <a>Auras</a>, and <a >Spirit</a> Skills.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul><li> <a>Combos</a> are three-stage melee attacks with a wide variety of types and effects, dealing damage plus buffs, debuffs, and more. Combo skills generate Spirit, the Monk's resource, which must be expended to cast his Auras and other skills.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a >Auras</a> are skills that provide a lasting bonus to the Monk and often to his allies, or that debuff enemies. They are cast to activate them, then persist for some duration.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a >Spirit</a> skills are all the rest. They cost spirit to cast, and provide a variety of direct attacks, defensive bonuses, or other varied properties.
        </li></ul>
    </section>
  
    <section>
        <h1 class="firstHeading">Combat System</h1>
        <p>The Monk's concept was that of a fighting game character, where the player could create combos by pressing the right buttons at the right time. This system evolved into the Monk's combos, all of which have three stages, though there's no real skill required to trigger them in sequence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Using a skill will cast the first stage of that skill. The player has a 0.6 second window to press the skill again to advance to the next stage of that (or a different) skill, that may lead to the 3rd stage of said skill. Alternatively, the player can wait for the 0.6 second window to pass, to re-use the first stage of the skill.
        </p>
        <br>
        An Example:
        <ul><li> Use/Objective of Skill(s): Easy for Beginners, Depth for veterans.
        </li>
            <br>
            <li> Stage One: Way of the Hundred Fists, move in close to the enemies.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Stage Two: Crippling Wave, lower the damage of the enemies.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Stage Three: Exploding Palm, Apply the DoT to a damaged enemy and watch the bunch of monsters go boom! (make sure the enemy dies before the bleed ends)
            </li>
        </ul>
